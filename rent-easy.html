            <p>With a goal of designing across a variety of devices, my team designed RentEasy for as a rental property platform 
              solution for common pain points like dead-end listings and no-show appointments. Together, we conducted
              research, modeled users, generate concepts, isolated high-value opportunities, and iteratively designed
              cross-device interaction.

                was crucial due to the large interaction with the leasing agent.</p>
              <p>We decided to pivot and focus on the Leasing Agent and Renter as our stakeholders. We were especially
                interested in the Leasing Agent perspective because we felt like they would benefit the most from a

                scheduling, and move-in) and challenges they're currently facing. This was very helpful for guidance
                on what to include in our prototypes.</p>

              <p>We discovered they use desktop and mobile devices most frequently. They thought a watch would be a
                helpful addition but they wouldn't reply on a watch to make any schedulings or communication.</p>

            <h4 class="rent-easy-txt bold">04 Lo-fi Wireframes</h4>
            <div class="container">
              <p>Based on our sketches, our team compiled a set of lo-fi wireframes. These designs were desktop and
                mobile focused as these two sizes are most frequently used by the Leasing Agent or Renter.</p>
              <p>We priotized desktop since they are most used while mobile serves as a synethsized version for
                "on-the-go" communication or schedulings.</p>
              <p>We mapped out the functionalities for both sizes and investigated how to best represent them across the
                two.</p>

              <p>The desktop view is broken down into dashboard, inbox, calendar/appointments, properties, tenants, and
                maintenance to echo our user interview findings.</p>
              <p>The dashboard is a collection of all important information, accessible at a glance, while all other
                pages include more details in specific categories. We studied existing design patterns and incorportaed
                them into our design (i.e. listings, calendar views).</p>
              <div class="container-fluid text-center mt-4 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/rent-easy/lofi-desktop.svg">
              </div>

              <p>As for mobile, the menu on the left in desktop is condensed into a hamburger on the top left. The tab
                bar at the bottom includes what we evaluated to be the most important functions – inbox, calendar, and
                account.</p>
              <p>It was challenging to think about how to organize information from the larger desktop screen to a small
                mobile screen while still displaying the same content. We asked the question "what would users most
                likely do with mobile vs. desktop?" to guide our design decisions.</p>

              <h5>Critique</h5>
              <p>Partnering with another team as well as discussion with our professors, we received valuable feedback
                on our lo-fi wireframes.</p>
              <p>Notes</p>
              <ul>
                <li>focus on a domain/problem we're solving</li>
                <li>responsiveness –– how can we manage content for multiple stakeholders across multiple devices?
                  (aiming for 4)</li>
                <li>zero in on one specific scenario rather than the whole platform –– especially scheduling</li>
                <li>interaction between leasing agent and renter into a specific scenario –– pain point of no-shows</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Based on this feedback, we took a closer look and discussed the scenario we wanted to focus on and
                divided the different screens/flows amongst our team members. I was specifically responsible for the
                mobile apppointment screens.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <p>Taking into account the feedback we received on our lo-fo wireframes, we continued with the design
                process towards hi-fi prototypes.</p>
              <h5>Initial Desktop Prototype</h5>
              <p>For the leasing agent, we kept the dashboard displaying weekly to-do's, inbox, and listings. It
                comprised of all the features we wanted to include but looking back we were definitely trying to make
                our design complete rather than novel.</p>
              <div class="container-fluid text-center mt-4 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/rent-easy/hifi-1.svg">
              </div>
              <p>As for the renter looking for an apartment and booking an appointment, our goal was to create a
                personalized, easy booking experience.</p>
              <div class="container-fluid text-center mt-4 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid mb-4" src="assets/img/rent-easy/hifi-2.svg">
                <img class="img-fluid mt-4" src="assets/img/rent-easy/hifi-3.svg">
              </div>

              <p>In addition to mobile, we also wanted to include a watch experience to increase the level of
                responsiveness in our design. Although the watch experience was overlooked in the speed dating session,
                our team felt like it still added value to the platform considering how time-sensitive notifications can
                be for the leasing agent.</p>
              <div class="container-fluid text-center mt-4 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid mb-4" src="assets/img/rent-easy/hifi-4.svg">
              </div>

              <h5>Critique</h5>
              <p>Presenting our work, we received more valuable feedback mainly on our platform features. We realized we
                lacked novel features to differentiate our solution to existing ones. Additionally, we needed a more
                scenario based user flow to present with such that the audience is able to put themselves in the
                situation and understand the needs we've addresses.</p>
              <p>Novel Feature Ideas</p>
              <ul>
                <li>consolidated flow for appointment scheduling</li>
                <li>adding "feedback flows" to integrate into the apartment matching experience</li>
                <li>highlighting connections between the useful "data" the platform has –– i.e. similar properies,
                  popular properties</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Design Decisions</h5>
              <p>Since we designed for two stakeholders simultaneously and presented them together, we made a
                distingushment between the two using two contrasting colors. Using orange for the leasing agent and blue
                for the renters helped both us and our audience differentiate when looking at our designs.</p>
              <p>Our UI follows a simplistic and modern design since from a UX aspect, we didn't want our design to
                distract or interfere from the user's goasl</p>
              <div class="container-fluid text-center mt-4 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid mb-4" src="assets/img/rent-easy/design-decisions.svg">
              </div>

              <h5>Responsive Elements</h5>
              <p>We kept important components (cards, tags, and navbar) the same across the different devices.</p>
              <p>There are also design patterns adopted from the digital product design space in order to make the
                platform easier to understand and use, ideally requiring no learning curve.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <h5>Renter</h5>
              <p>The main change from the previous iteration is the "connect with agent" button on the left side. We
                found the previous "submit appointment" wording to be inaccurate here and added friction.</p>
              <p>We also added a "selling point" tag next to some listening for users to easily learn more while
                browsing without needed to click into the listing.</p>
              <div class="container-fluid text-center mt-4 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid mb-4" src="assets/img/rent-easy/final-1.svg">
                <img class="img-fluid mt-4" src="assets/img/rent-easy/final-2.svg">
              </div>
              <p>We also changed the scheduling overlay design so that the user can select a specific time and receive
                feedback
                after submitting the apointment. Additionally, we received feedback during our pitch about the
                scheduling experience still feeling generic and not solving the issue of "dead-end" listings. Based on
                this, we also decided to add the listing agent to the listing to make the experience more personal from
                the beginning.</p>
              <div class="container-fluid text-center mt-4 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid mb-4" src="assets/img/rent-easy/final-3.svg">

              </div>

              <p>To address the common pain point of no-show tenants for viewings, we implemented two different
                solutions to ensure the renter has the opportunity to easily communicate with the leasing agent.</p>
              <p>First, the renter is prompted to confirm the appointment 24 hours in advance to ensure timeliess of any
                changes needed on the renter's end.</p>
              <div class="container-fluid text-center mt-4 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/rent-easy/final-5.svg">
              </div>
              <p>Second, the platform pushes another notification 45 minutes prior to the appointment via inbox so that
                the renter is prompted to communicate with the leasing agent again for any clarifications or questions.
              </p>
              <div class="container-fluid text-center mt-4 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/rent-easy/final-6.svg">
              </div>
              <p>Viewings don't always end with the renter wanting to sign –– they're often interested other similar
                listings. Therefore, there's value in their feedback to improve the both the search process for the
                tenant and the listing or viewing process itself. Based on this, we thought it would be useful to
                incorporate a feedback form where the renter can provide their personal opinions and insight. The renter
                will also benefit from this since the data collected will allow the platform to generate better listing
                recommendations.</p>
              <div class="container-fluid text-center mt-4 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/rent-easy/final-7.svg">

                <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/rent-easy/final-8.svg">
              </div>

              <h5>Leasing Agent</h5>
              <p>From the leasing agent's side, we added a detailed flow for sending documents. Originally, we had only
                one button that would send "all" documents but realized that was impractical and the leasing agent would
                need different document selections.</p>
              <p>We also changed the appointment details screen for better precision on mobile tapping.</p>
              <div class="container-fluid text-center mt-4 mb-4">
                <img class="img-fluid mb-4" src="assets/img/rent-easy/final-9.svg">
                <img class="img-fluid mt-4" src="assets/img/rent-easy/final-10.svg">
              </div>

              <p>Lastly for the leasing agent dashboard, we added a new feature of "upcoming and current availabilites"
                that also utilizes "priority" tags for listings with longer vacant periods have higher visibilty. Since
                the dashboard was designed to improve workflow and efficiency, we felt adding small changes helped with
                visualizing priorities and minimize mental load.</p>

        <p>As the final assignment in Interaction Design Studio 1, I felt like everything we had spent the semester
          learning had built up to this point where we were challenged with creating our designs through a full process.
          I
          felt the prompt we received felt broad and difficult to address in the beginning but as we went through our
          initial research, scenarios & storyboards, and our first two design iterations, I finally understood the
          overall
          goal in building a solution to issues we identified across different devices for a whole responsive design.
          From
          there, I found it very helpful to narrow our scope, identify key innovative features, and define each piece in
          the larger platform and user flow.</p>
        <p>While our deadlines were quick and required fast turnaround, as a team, we were able to work collaboratively
          and efficiently through good communication. I felt I learned a lot from working so closely with diverse skill
          sets and backgrounds. I especially found our in-class working sessions to be solid productive time for us to
          get
          feedback, discuss actions items, and decide on changes to implement. These sessions were crucial to our
          success
          as a team and allowed us to space and time needed toward such a complex project.</p>
