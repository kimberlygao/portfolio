        <p>A mod log is <span class="bold reddit-txt">a list of all mod or admin actions taken in a community</span>, ensuring transparency within the mod team. 
           This includes actions like removing post, removing comments, changing settings, banning users, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>Mod teams use their mod log for different purposes like train/guide new moderators, checks for historical actions and consistencies, fix mistakes, and see if another mod is currently modding.</p>
        <p>On desktop or web, a mod log contains filters by time frame, moderator, actions, username, and post url. On mobile, there are only two filters â€“ moderator and actions.</p>
        <p>My work <span class="bold reddit-txt">completes the missing 3 filters on mobile</span> (time frame, username, and post url), providing the same functionality available on desktop (and 3rd party platforms).</p>

        <p>Reddit has it's own design system, Reddit Product Language (RPL). Though I was familiar with Figma and its component functionality, RPL was far more robust in design practices and principles that I had used before so <span class="reddit-txt bold">I spent time reading documentation, testing, and understanding how to best use Reddit's design system.</span></p>

        <p>While filtering by different categories seems trivial, user input can be prompted in various forms leading to many possible design opportunities.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-10 col-lg-6 offset-1 pt-5">
        <p>For time frame â€“ I worked with the design systems team to create a RPL date picker pattern using native iOS and Android components. This did not exist yet since there was no previous use for it. I also realized I was able to improve the existing experience by adding set time frames in addition to custom dates. Given that mods want quick and easy actions, I decided to prioritize set time frames in the flow before custom time frames.</p>

        <p>For username â€“ I wanted to use a search pattern to minimize user input error but there was pushback to make this a P1 by product. Thus, P0 opted for a simple exact match input â€“ same as desktop. It wasn't clear to me whether or not the "u/" needed to be included in front of the input on desktop. Thus, I added a greyed out "u/" at the front of the input box. With the design intention, if a user inputed the "u/" themselves, it would be matching to the existing label to increase system transparency and feedforward.</p>

        <p>For post URL â€“ the expected user journey is to copy and paste a post link rather than typing in just the post ID (which is the input requirement for desktop). Entering the post ID is much more difficult given the limitations of mobile and the ability to access the post ID as opposed to copying the post link. In this case, the design is simple with a "post URL" label indicating a link is needed. One step further would be to recognize that a post link has been copied and to parse the ID from the URL to show up in the keyboard such that the user doesn't need to active the paste, but we deemed this to be low priority and high effort for this milestone.</p>

        <p>With the designs of the 3 filters missing on mobile, developing them to be released on the app will improve the parity gap between desktop and mobile. This is a feature mods have been asking about for a while since some mods only use the mobile app.</p>
        <p class="heading bold">personal</p>
        <p>I accomplished this project in the first week of my internship as a simpler project to ease myself into the Reddit design world.</p>
        <p>Often creating my own design systems, this was my first time learning and utilizing a robust design system documentation with Figma components. In order for such a large product to remain consistent and cohesive, the design system needs to be clear, direct, and standardized with information design. I gained insight into what is necessary to accomplish such and how it affects creating prototypes and design opportunties.</p>
        <P>With this first project, building domain knowledge was the most important for making informed design decisions. It was valuable to me as someone who has never used mod tools, to be able to read discussions by mods about their issues and watch recorded contextual inquiries with mods of the largest communities.</P>

           This provides a collaborative, consistent space for communication across mod teams within the Reddit system. </p>
        <p>At this point, modmail in the native app was the same experience as mobile and desktop web (just responsive), resulting in issues with intuitiveness and usability. More specifically, the experiece lacked content prioritization, platform specific design practices, and screen size optimization for a mobile app.</p>

        <p>The first item on the page was "Post from" in which the wording was confusing to me in the context of mail. The "Selecting a community" dropdown button indicated that this would be a community of one of the mods or "where" they are sending modmail from. Tapping on the button revealed a dropdown menu of all communities the user moderates. This dropdown menu relies on the device's system rather than RPL components since dropdown menus are not part of RPL for mobile as they take up much of the screen and offer a poorer UX.</p>
        <p>Based on these observations, I changed the dropdown menu to a bottom sheet for a more mobile friendly layout and to maintain visibility of the main/background information. Additionally, some users are mods of many communities such that they would need to scroll extensively and the bottom sheet allows for a search bar as well.</p>

        <p>With the existing design, a mod was to "Post from" a specific community and the three choice types were "Moderator Discussion", "To User", and "To Subreddit". These 3 recipient choices existed as a radio button selection which indicated to me only one could be chosen. I perceived the radio button selection to take up too much real estate on the screen in addition to radio buttons not being part of RPL for mobile app. </p>
        <p>To reduce cognitive overload, improve progressive disclosure, and mirror sender selection, I decided to move this selection into a bottom sheet. This offered mods a more focused flow and view as well as better understanding of what the next action to take is.</p>

        <p>But what did a "Moderator Discussion" mean? Where would this go? Asking my mentor, this was a discussion post amongst the mods in the community selected in "Post from". While this functionality is offered, many mods opt for Slack or Discord to faciliate team discussions, likely because of the difficult experience in Modmail.</p>
        <p>I simplified this selection down to just "Moderators" such that the phrasing matched the other two recipients. To clarify what a "Moderators" means, I wrote and added a description underneath the selection. This location is typically where the value of the selection would go, breaking a design pattern in which I discussed and gained approval from the design systems team who supported due to the complexity of the interaction.</p>

      <div class="col-10 col-lg-6 offset-1 pt-5">
        <p>As for "To User" and "To Subreddit", selecting either of these options led to a input field to appear to type a specific community or username in. This was a rather jarring change of the interface and required the user to be utmost precise with their inputted names, not offering suggestions while typing or search.</p>
        <p>I changed "To User" to simply be "User" and made "To" the label for the dropdown. For "User", I placed the input field nested in the bottom sheet, again improving progressive disclore. Entering an exact username/community was P0 and the ability to search was P1, similar to Modlog.</p>
        <p>Also when "To User is selected, the option to "Hide my username" appears at the bottom of the screen. This allows mods to remain anonymous as the mod team and hides their indiviudal username, preventing targeted harassment from upset community members, a common issue for mods. Due to the distance from the click that prompted the option, I learned mods often forget to check the box before sending modmail.</p>

Due to the distance from the click that prompted the option, I learned mods often forget to check the box before sending modmail.</p>
        <p>Though this option is only associated with a user, I found it important for the mods to see this on the main page rather than nested in the bottom sheet as it offers system transparency and is highly important. Adding the label "As" with a toggle between "Mod team" and "u/username" directly underneath the "From" selections reduces the likelihood of overlooking the selection. Defaulting to "Mod team" solves the issue of forgetting to check the box. Mods rarely send as their own username, but when they do, it's important to know what account they are sending from since mods tend to have many accounts as well.</p>

        <p>Mentioned previously, selecting "To Subreddit" opens an text field to enter an exact subreddit name. Subreddit names can be long and requiring an exact input fails to prevent user error with typing and spelling. Additionally, since this version of modmail was created, Reddit has moved away from using the term "subreddit" and replaced it with "community".</p>
        <p>The nested bottom sheet in this case generates a list of all communities with the option to search. This decreases user error and also increases efficiency.</p>

        <p>Another consideration I thought heavily about was the order in which to put the sender and recipient. "Post from" first makes sense since the community selected contextualizes the remaning message. Observing other mail client apps and the traditional envelope addressing, the design pattern is typically "To" then "From". </p>
        <p>After testing both orders and considering ease of use, I decided to follow the design pattern of entering the recepient then sender.</p>

        <p class="heading bold">how to actually hit send</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-10 col-lg-6 offset-1">
        <p>The send button had the most possible placements and the least straightforward answer. Without thinking heavily, I initially placed "Send Message" at the bottom while I was focused on the selections above. But after going through the flow and prototyping a keyboard in, I realized a mod is most likely to want to hit send after typing out their message where the keyboard would cover or push the button up. Looking into other mail clients, most of them have their send button on the top right which I found to be inconvenient to reach for.</p>
        <p>I turned towards and idea of a floating button that appeared when on the "Message" field since that was likely the location the user would be ready to send and offered an easy tap once they finished. I replaced the label with an arrow send icon as a standard representation of "send". This also helped minimize space. Additionally, the button remains disabled until all the required fields are fulfilled to prevent user error. Lastly, the floating button only when on the message minimizes the number of buttons on the screen such that the mod can focus more on their task at hand.</p>
        <p>One argument against this floating button is if the mod goes back to the "Subject" field (i.e. to fix a typo), the button disappears. This might caught confusion for user as their ability to send disappears. Their next course of action is likely to double check their message typing for any typos such that they click back into the "Message" field and can hit send. Either way, to send would require one more tap and consulting other designers, we found it to be acceptable in this user journey.</p>

        <p>The last major change was the "Formatting Help" that was previously available at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on the button would open a deprecated web page about commetting markdown on an in app browser. The long and extensive site was difficult to naviagate and had excess unneccesary information.</p>
        <p>Pulling out the most important and likely to be used markdown notations, I put those inside a table that is now displayed in a full-screen bottom sheet for reference. Since markdown is only available for use in the "Message" field, the point of entry is now a floating button similar to the send button.</p>

        <p>As this project was part of a larger update to the entire Modmail system, my designs shipped and went into development during the second half my internship. After reviewing, tweaking, and getting final approval of my work, I began to collaborate with product and engineering to continue progressing. This involved some back and forth communications with engineering to clarify intended behavior and add any additional requirements. I familiarized myself with empty states and error states which I had not created before. This was where we are allowed to be more creative and show more of the Reddit personality and tone. I collaborated with the content design team here as well to ensure I was following their guidelines. While I completed this designs for this project in about two weeks, I continued supporting it throughout my internship and am happy to share that it was released onto the app in November 2023. It was extremely exciting to see what I created on the official Reddit app.</p>
        <p class="heading bold">personal</p>
        <p>This was definitely my favorite project of the three I worked on during my summer. I learned I really enjoy thinking through interaction design problems and especially on mobile where the challenges are more complex despite a smaller screen. This was also my first time as a designer working with an engineer who built out my feature. Learning how to communicate effectively was a big part of my growth as it taught me what is important for me to provide such that there are less gaps for development. Overall, I am very proud of my work here and taking a complex interaction to a flow that is more usable and elegant for mods.</p>
