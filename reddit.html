        <p>A mod log is <span class="bold reddit-txt">a list of all mod or admin actions taken in a community</span>, ensuring transparency within the mod team. 
           This includes actions like removing post, removing comments, changing settings, banning users, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>Mod teams use their mod log for different purposes like train/guide new moderators, checks for historical actions and consistencies, fix mistakes, and see if another mod is currently modding.</p>
        <p>On desktop or web, a mod log contains filters by time frame, moderator, actions, username, and post url. On mobile, there are only two filters â€“ moderator and actions.</p>
        <p>My work <span class="bold reddit-txt">completes the missing 3 filters on mobile</span> (time frame, username, and post url), providing the same functionality available on desktop (and 3rd party platforms).</p>

        <p>Reddit has it's own design system, Reddit Product Language (RPL). Though I was familiar with Figma and its component functionality, RPL was far more robust in design practices and principles that I had used before so <span class="reddit-txt bold">I spent time reading documentation, testing, and understanding how to best use Reddit's design system.</span></p>

        <p>While filtering by different categories seems trivial, user input can be prompted in various forms leading to many possible design opportunities.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-10 col-lg-6 offset-1 pt-5">
        <p>For time frame â€“ I worked with the design systems team to create a RPL date picker pattern using native iOS and Android components. This did not exist yet since there was no previous use for it. I also realized I was able to improve the existing experience by adding set time frames in addition to custom dates. Given that mods want quick and easy actions, I decided to prioritize set time frames in the flow before custom time frames.</p>

        <p>For username â€“ I wanted to use a search pattern to minimize user input error but there was pushback to make this a P1 by product. Thus, P0 opted for a simple exact match input â€“ same as desktop. It wasn't clear to me whether or not the "u/" needed to be included in front of the input on desktop. Thus, I added a greyed out "u/" at the front of the input box. With the design intention, if a user inputed the "u/" themselves, it would be matching to the existing label to increase system transparency and feedforward.</p>

        <p>For post URL â€“ the expected user journey is to copy and paste a post link rather than typing in just the post ID (which is the input requirement for desktop). Entering the post ID is much more difficult given the limitations of mobile and the ability to access the post ID as opposed to copying the post link. In this case, the design is simple with a "post URL" label indicating a link is needed. One step further would be to recognize that a post link has been copied and to parse the ID from the URL to show up in the keyboard such that the user doesn't need to active the paste, but we deemed this to be low priority and high effort for this milestone.</p>

        <p>With the designs of the 3 filters missing on mobile, developing them to be released on the app will improve the parity gap between desktop and mobile. This is a feature mods have been asking about for a while since some mods only use the mobile app.</p>
        <p class="heading bold">personal</p>
        <p>I accomplished this project in the first week of my internship as a simpler project to ease myself into the Reddit design world.</p>
        <p>Often creating my own design systems, this was my first time learning and utilizing a robust design system documentation with Figma components. In order for such a large product to remain consistent and cohesive, the design system needs to be clear, direct, and standardized with information design. I gained insight into what is necessary to accomplish such and how it affects creating prototypes and design opportunties.</p>
        <P>With this first project, building domain knowledge was the most important for making informed design decisions. It was valuable to me as someone who has never used mod tools, to be able to read discussions by mods about their issues and watch recorded contextual inquiries with mods of the largest communities.</P>

           This provides a collaborative, consistent space for communication across mod teams within the Reddit system. </p>
        <p>At this point, modmail in the native app was the same experience as mobile and desktop web (just responsive), resulting in issues with intuitiveness and usability. More specifically, the experiece lacked content prioritization, platform specific design practices, and screen size optimization for a mobile app.</p>

        <p>The first item on the page was "Post from" in which the wording was confusing to me in the context of mail. The "Selecting a community" dropdown button indicated that this would be a community of one of the mods or "where" they are sending modmail from. Tapping on the button revealed a dropdown menu of all communities the user moderates. This dropdown menu relies on the device's system rather than RPL components since dropdown menus are not part of RPL for mobile as they take up much of the screen and offer a poorer UX.</p>
        <p>Based on these observations, I changed the dropdown menu to a bottom sheet for a more mobile friendly layout and to maintain visibility of the main/background information. Additionally, some users are mods of many communities such that they would need to scroll extensively and the bottom sheet allows for a search bar as well.</p>

        <p>With the existing design, a mod was to "Post from" a specific community and the three choice types were "Moderator Discussion", "To User", and "To Subreddit". These 3 recipient choices existed as a radio button selection which indicated to me only one could be chosen. I perceived the radio button selection to take up too much real estate on the screen in addition to radio buttons not being part of RPL for mobile app. </p>
        <p>To reduce cognitive overload, improve progressive disclosure, and mirror sender selection, I decided to move this selection into a bottom sheet. This offered mods a more focused flow and view as well as better understanding of what the next action to take is.</p>

        <p>But what did a "Moderator Discussion" mean? Where would this go? Asking my mentor, this was a discussion post amongst the mods in the community selected in "Post from". While this functionality is offered, many mods opt for Slack or Discord to faciliate team discussions, likely because of the difficult experience in Modmail.</p>
        <p>I simplified this selection down to just "Moderators" such that the phrasing matched the other two recipients. To clarify what a "Moderators" means, I wrote and added a description underneath the selection. This location is typically where the value of the selection would go, breaking a design pattern in which I discussed and gained approval from the design systems team who supported due to the complexity of the interaction.</p>

        <p>As for "To User" and "To Subreddit", selecting either of these options led to a input field to appear to type a specific community or username in. This was a rather jarring change of the interface and required the user to be utmost precise with their inputted names, not offering suggestions while typing or search.</p>
        <p>I changed "To User" to simply be "User" and made "To" the label for the dropdown. For "User", I placed the input field nested in the bottom sheet, again improving progressive disclore. Entering an exact username/community was P0 and the ability to search was P1, similar to Modlog.</p>
        <p>Also when "To User is selected, the option to "Hide my username" appears at the bottom of the screen. This allows mods to remain anonymous as the mod team and hides their indiviudal username, preventing targeted harassment from upset community members, a common issue for mods. Due to the distance from the click that prompted the option, I learned mods often forget to check the box before sending modmail.</p>

Due to the distance from the click that prompted the option, I learned mods often forget to check the box before sending modmail.</p>
        <p>Though this option is only associated with a user, I found it important for the mods to see this on the main page rather than nested in the bottom sheet as it offers system transparency and is highly important. Adding the label "As" with a toggle between "Mod team" and "u/username" directly underneath the "From" selections reduces the likelihood of overlooking the selection. Defaulting to "Mod team" solves the issue of forgetting to check the box. Mods rarely send as their own username, but when they do, it's important to know what account they are sending from since mods tend to have many accounts as well.</p>

        <p>Mentioned previously, selecting "To Subreddit" opens an text field to enter an exact subreddit name. Subreddit names can be long and requiring an exact input fails to prevent user error with typing and spelling. Additionally, since this version of modmail was created, Reddit has moved away from using the term "subreddit" and replaced it with "community".</p>
        <p>The nested bottom sheet in this case generates a list of all communities with the option to search. This decreases user error and also increases efficiency.</p>

        <p>Another consideration I thought heavily about was the order in which to put the sender and recipient. "Post from" first makes sense since the community selected contextualizes the remaning message. Observing other mail client apps and the traditional envelope addressing, the design pattern is typically "To" then "From". </p>
        <p>After testing both orders and considering ease of use, I decided to follow the design pattern of entering the recepient then sender.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-10 col-lg-4 offset-1">
        <p>The send button had the most possible placements and the least straightforward answer. Without thinking heavily, I initially placed "Send Message" at the bottom while I was focused on the selections above. But after going through the flow and prototyping a keyboard in, I realized a mod is most likely to want to hit send after typing out their message where the keyboard would cover or push the button up. Looking into other mail clients, most of them have their send button on the top right which I found to be inconvenient to reach for.</p>
        <p>I turned towards and idea of a floating button that appeared when on the "Message" field since that was likely the location the user would be ready to send and offered an easy tap once they finished. I replaced the label with an arrow send icon as a standard representation of "send". This also helped minimize space. Additionally, the button remains disabled until all the required fields are fulfilled to prevent user error. Lastly, the floating button only when on the message minimizes the number of buttons on the screen such that the mod can focus more on their task at hand.</p>
        <p>One argument against this floating button is if the mod goes back to the "Subject" field (i.e. to fix a typo), the button disappears. This might caught confusion for user as their ability to send disappears. Their next course of action is likely to double check their message typing for any typos such that they click back into the "Message" field and can hit send. Either way, to send would require one more tap and consulting other designers, we found it to be acceptable in this user journey.</p>

        <p>The last major change was the "Formatting Help" that was previously available at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on the button would open a deprecated web page about commetting markdown on an in app browser. The long and extensive site was difficult to naviagate and had excess unneccesary information.</p>
        <p>Pulling out the most important and likely to be used markdown notations, I put those inside a table that is now displayed in a full-screen bottom sheet for reference. Since markdown is only available for use in the "Message" field, the point of entry is now a floating button similar to the send button.</p>

        <p>As this project was part of a larger update to the entire Modmail system, my designs shipped and went into development during the second half my internship. After reviewing, tweaking, and getting final approval of my work, I began to collaborate with product and engineering to continue progressing. This involved some back and forth communications with engineering to clarify intended behavior and add any additional requirements. I familiarized myself with empty states and error states which I had not created before. This was where we are allowed to be more creative and show more of the Reddit personality and tone. I collaborated with the content design team here as well to ensure I was following their guidelines. While I completed this designs for this project in about two weeks, I continued supporting it throughout my internship and am happy to share that it was released onto the app in November 2023. It was extremely exciting to see what I created on the official Reddit app.</p>
        <p class="heading bold">personal</p>
        <p>This was definitely my favorite project of the three I worked on during my summer. I learned I really enjoy thinking through interaction design problems and especially on mobile where the challenges are more complex despite a smaller screen. This was also my first time as a designer working with an engineer who built out my feature. Learning how to communicate effectively was a big part of my growth as it taught me what is important for me to provide such that there are less gaps for development. Overall, I am very proud of my work here and taking a complex interaction to a flow that is more usable and elegant for mods.</p>

        <p>As this project is all exploratory work, I was pretty overwhelmed with all the directions and opportunities. And since I was a fresh pair of eyes on the team, the designers wanted to see what I could generate on my own without their input and influence. This led me to do a TON of research to determine more specific pain points to address.</p>
        <p>With no specific problem or goal at hand, I first aimed to set one â€“ find a problem and determine potential goals for the project. I did this by watching recorded Mod Shadow sessions (contextual inquiry with mods of different communities) where individuals are asked to share screen and think aloud through their modding process. I watched about 3 of these hour long sessions, noting observations and especially similarities across different mods.</p>

        <p>Based on all the research I gathered, I created an objective with a problem, goals, and context as a snapshot basis for moving forward.</p>
        <p>Throughout the project I then asked, "How might we prioritize efficiency, accuracy & consistency for inline moderation tools in PDP?" such that we might streamline actions with the mod queue, improve comment thread management, optimize mobile specific behaviors, etc.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>cleaning up comments from posts that are already removed, showing posts from banned user in mod queue -> removing all content froma user given a time frame (ex: troll in community with a ton of hate comments)</li>

        <p>Between my own ideas and our brainstorm session, I narrowed to 6 concrete ideas to sketch and flesh out visually.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>comment guidance</li>
          <li>sticky any user's comment</li>

        <p>It was helpful to get feedback through questions being asked and holes being poked to understand where I needed to improve on conveying and justifying ideas.</p>

        <p>At this point, with 6 ideas, I wasn't sure which to continue pursing but I definitely wouldn't do all of them. My mentor guided me by doing a quick prioritization matrix of impact vs effort.</p>
        <p>The matrix showed user panel and mod only discussion to be the two ideas that should be prioritized first. Discussing the user panel more, we decided against it since it wasn't a necessarily new idea and needed improvement as it's accessed from several surfaces. Instead, mod-only discussions was more true to the PDP context of my project and a new concept to tackle of a long standing problem.</p>
        <p>Mod mode was also an area interesting to me which I felt would highly benefit from exploratory work given its complexity and dated design.</p>

        <p>For desktop, an expand button on the comment to open a side panel was the simplest point of entry. The design team was looking for ways to utilize side panel real estate to supply mods with more information and to accomplish tasks.</p>

      <div class="col-10 col-lg-4 offset-1 pt-5">
        <p>I then took these sketches and created initial frames in Figma. At this point, I was trying to generate as many variations as I could for the interaction.</p>
        <p>Since comment nesting has a pre-defined pattern, my tasks was a matter of providing navigation between the comments. I added variations of jumping to the parent or root of the comment. I also considered whether the parent comment should be shown or not upon opening the comment thread panel.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-10 col-lg-4 offset-1 pt-5">
        <p>Considering that a bottom sheet provides half the screen space and there is no need to see the background of the same content, I opted to make the panel into full screen and continued adjusting the controls.</p>
        <p>I eventually progressed on my iterations from left to right, realizing I didn't need to have a title that was default to the component. The navigation buttons made the most sense aligned top left away from bulk controls pinned to the bottom.</p>
        <p>Jumping to parent and root were given labels to help distinguish between the single and double up arrow while going left and right to children didn't need the labels since familiarity would grow with discovery.</p>
        <p>Another important consideration was bulk actions as in approving/removing multiple comments at once. "Nuking" is available through third party clients as well as Toolbox (add def here) but not provided natively as a Reddit feature. There was pushback on it previously but through discussion with my design team, they felt product would benefit from exploratory work here again.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-10 col-lg-4 offset-1 pt-5">
          <p>With the full sheets, I also started considering sibling comments and jumping to those threads as well. Given the "tree" hierarchy of comments, it was challenging to determine relative locations of comments to the user and how to best position and display them.</p>
          <p>Given that parent, root and children run vertically, I decided to place jumping to siblings with a horizontal sliding animation to help convey that one was essentially moving "sideways" across the comments.</p>

      <div class="col-10 col-lg-6 offset-1 pt-5">
        <p>From here, I created my first prototype starting from the PDP and going through all the jumping navigations, ending with a bulk remove.</p>
        <p>After my first round of prototyping, I shared my explorations with r/RedditModCouncil, a private subreddit with ~400 mods to participate in communicating with Reddit admins for feature feedback, primary research, and other design/research needs. </p>
        <p>For comment threading, I set the motivations, explained the prototype, and then asked mods "What actions are you interested in taking here? What else would you like to see here?". I received the following feedback:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I like the easy movement to the parent comment maintaing the report text. Very often I try to go into context of a slap fight between two or more users and I need to do a lot of scrolling to find the source to take mod actions. On mobile this is a challenge.</li>
          <li>The comment navigator is awesome. Maybe 'expand all reports' to see how many report children comments that thread has.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also shared this prototype in design studio review where I was questioned on my proposed solution to navigating comment threads. I was challenged to think outside of a bottom sheet solution to see what I could further generate as this would take much engineering efforts and build outside the PDP rather than improve upon.</p>

        <p class="heading bold">back to the comments drawing board</p>
        <p>Based on my studio feedback, I veered away from continuing to develop a comment thread bottom sheet and explore other solutions to this problem. I turned towards my original research and pain points I identified.</p>
        <p>mod quotes from various threads</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trying to see the context of a comment on the app rarely words if the comment is nested too deep in the thread. That's the biggest downside for modding on the app for me.</li>
          <li>What about navigating up and down comment threads? Like if the comment in the video was a reply to comething, we need to be able to go back up to that parent comments. And then down to its replies. This used ot be semi-possible on mobile, but they removed it for some reason. The only alternative is so load all the comments and find the thread from the top down. If it's a very large post that is way too much work.</li>
          <li>Navigating through comment chains like through parent comments is really tedius on the official app.</li>
          <li>If the comment needs context, the experience is abysmal, especially if the comment is hiding in a post with hundreds of comments somewhere deep in a chain with little upvotes.</li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <div class="col-10 col-lg-6 offset-1 pt-5">
        <p>With the context panel being a large feature, I aimed for smaller, more integrated solutions. As navigation, I tried adding the jump to buttons in existing menus and functionalities. </p>
        <p>Here was a first mockup of putting these buttons into the mod menu for a comment. The functions by allowing to just jump up or horizontally, then needing to scroll back down. Much of this functionality is aimed at going back up in tackling the same context issue mentioned above.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-10 col-lg-3 offset-1 pt-5">
        <p>My second idea here uses the down arrow floating action button (FAB) that lives on the bottom right of the PDP. Tapping on this button will jump to next root comment. Holding down on the button allows you to move and place the button anywhere.</p>
        <p>This idea expands on an already existing navigation, proposing that the long press opens an additional menu of navigation actions.</p>
        <p>An issue here is how to determine what comment a mod is currently looking at, since multiple comments appear on the page together.</p>

        <p class="heading bold">now we have integrated comment navigation</p>
        <p>To solve the previous issue of determining where the comment is, I simplified this interaction in only offering jumping to the root of the comment. Another way to acheive this is to hold down on the comment to collapse the entire thread from the root and then reopen that thread. This interaction is not intuitive to acheive the same result and the movement on screen is quite jerky. Later in another focus of this project, I also propose a new iteraction for long pressing on a comment such that there is a trade off of entry points as well.</p>
        <p>To this menu, I also included jumping to the next reported item in the PDP such that mods can quickly move to the next item that needs immediate attention. This is especially useful in threads where a lot of content has been reported and it's easier to scroll through the PDP rather than relying on the mod queue.</p>

        <p class="heading bold">oh comment prioritization too!</p>
        <p>Building upon wanting to be able to easily see reported content in the PDP, I drafted up an additional way to sort the comments â€“ by "Needs Review". This would surface every reported comment to the top, maintaining its root and direct parent of the comment, collapsing all others. Comments with the most reports will be shown first and followed by which were reported earliest (decreasing order and chronologically).</p>
        <p>The need for this was highlighted heavily during a contextual inquiry shadow I conducted with a mod of r/BachelorNation. While a new episode airs every Monday, the mod will watch and mod the live discussion thread on mobile in which I observed and asked questions. Because all of this modding occurs in one place, it would be useful to resurface reported content every so often through sort as she would sort by "New" regularly to see fresh content. Switching between the two would offer greater coverage in finding inappropriate content to the community.</p>
        <p>This additional sort method builds upon the current offerings of the PDP in which all the components are already built and would only need an additional sorting algorithm to complete.</p>

        <p class="heading bold">to summarize</p>
        <p>These 3 broken down features (jump to root or next reported + sorting by "Needs Review" + bulk remove) accomplish similar tasks to the comment thread panel but within existing features on the PDP as potential alternative route. Given more time, I would be curious to A/B test these ideas to better understand their value and conjoined usability.</p>

        <p class="heading bold reddit-txt">core idea #2</p>
        <p class="heading bold">creating space for mods to discuss</p>
        <p>The main motivation here is from mod teams using Slack or Discord to talk about content they are unsure about. This requires a mod to copy a link, go to an external app, start a discussion there, keep tabs externally, and then finally return to Reddit to finally take action. Responders to the discussion have first look at the conversation and then go to Reddit to understand the content and then back to the external app. Though this doesn't sound terrible for one discussion, extending this to 1000 problematic comments then becomes very tedious.</p>

        <p>I sketched the interaction out a little more, determining the entry point is a menu item in a mod actions list (potentially mod queue or PDP) and this expands to side panel (desktop) or bottom sheet (mobile) with a UI potentially similar to modmail.</p>

        <p>From sketching to my first prototype, the mod only comment thread turned into a mod only discussion to help distinguish from user comments and show a greater need for attention from mods.</p>
        <p>My first prototype flows as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>on a post, opens mod menu</li>
          <li>starts a discussion, sending the first message</li>

        <p>With the basic functionality outlined, I began considering the next action a mod would take. After reading the responses, they are likely to approve/remove the content. Thus, these actions should be easily accessible.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>top left: location seems related to messaging, mod shield might not communicate the actions available</li>
          <li>top right: not sure what I am confirming or denying, not always available (only when not focused on input field)</li>
          <li>bottom left: not an existing pattern, feels weird, vertical FAB is not in design systems</li>

        <p>Based on the options generated, top left remained the most viable given its similarity to modmail's UI with actions on left and is also following existing patterns of actions on the left in other messaging platforms (ex: iMessage).</p>

        <p>Actions to approve or remove are only available after responses from other mods have been sent, not when the first message is sent. The mod approving/removing the post also updates the recent action bar as such and closes the discussion.</p>
