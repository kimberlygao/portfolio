        <p>A mod log is <span class="bold reddit-txt">a list of all mod or admin actions taken in a community</span>, ensuring transparency within the mod team. 
           This includes actions like removing post, removing comments, changing settings, banning users, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>Mod teams use their mod log for different purposes like train/guide new moderators, checks for historical actions and consistencies, fix mistakes, and see if another mod is currently modding.</p>
        <p>On desktop or web, a mod log contains filters by time frame, moderator, actions, username, and post url. On mobile, there are only two filters – moderator and actions.</p>
        <p>My work <span class="bold reddit-txt">completes the missing 3 filters on mobile</span> (time frame, username, and post url), providing the same functionality available on desktop (and 3rd party platforms).</p>

        <p>Having only the basic knowledge of what a moderator does, <span class="bold reddit-txt">I had a lot to learn about mod motivations and goals</span>. I read tons of mod posts and comments (secondary research), watched many shadow sessions (contextual inquiry), and asked questions in order to build my own mental model.</p>
        <p class="mb-2 bold reddit-txt">The essentials to mods – </p>
        <ul>
          <li>mods prioritize efficiency (above anything else)</li>
          <li>each mod has their preferred platform – old reddit, new reddit, mobile app, mobile web, etc.</li>
          <li>each mod has their preferred method – modding from individual posts, the mod queue, push notifications, etc.</li>
          <li>mods tend to chat with their team about issues on discord, slack, etc</li>
          <li>every mod team has different rules and norms for their communities</li>
          <li>mods are often part of multiple mod teams for different communities</li>
          <li>mods often have multiple accounts for different purposes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reddit's UX has it's own design system, Reddit Product Language (RPL). Though familiar with Figma and its component functionality, RPL was far more robust in design practices and principles that I had used before so <span class="reddit-txt bold">I spent time reading documentation, testing, and understanding how to best use Reddit's design system.</span></p>
        <div class="row" style="height: 2vh"></div>
        <p class="heading bold">considering different methods of input</p>
        <p>While filtering by different categories seems trivial, user input can be accepted in various forms leading to many possible design opportunities.</p>
        <p>For time frame – I worked with the design systems team to create a date picker component which did not exist yet. In addition to creating the ability to filter on mobile, I realized I was able to improve the existing experience past the simplicity entering two dates. Given that mods want quick and easy actions, I prioritized set time frames before custom time frames which are less likely to be used.</p>
        <p>For username – it wasn't clear to me whether or not the "u/" needed to be included in front of the input on desktop. Thus, I added a greyed out "u/" at the front of the input box. With the design intention, if a user inputed the "u/" themselves, it would be matching to the existing label to minimize user error beyond increased transparency.</p>
        <p>For post URL – the expected user journey is to copy and paste a post link rather than the post ID (which is the input requirement for desktop). In this case, the design is simple with a post URL label.</p>

        <p>With the designs of the 3 filters missing on mobile, developing them to be released on the app will improve the parity gap between desktop and mobile. This is a feature mods have been asking about for a while since some mods only use the app and cannot accomplish the same tasks.</p>
        <p class="heading bold">personal</p>
        <p>Often creating my own design systems, this was my first time learning and utilizing a robust design system documentation with Figma components. In order for such a large product to remain consistent and cohesive, the design system needs to be clear, direct, and standardized with information design. I gained insight into what is necessary to accomplish such and how it affects creating prototypes and design opportunties.</p>
        <P>With this first project, building domain knowledge was the most important for making informed design decisions. It was valuable to me as someone who has never used mod tools, to be able to read discussions by mods about their issues and watch recorded contextual inquiries with mods of the largest communities.</P>

        <p class="heading bold">the need for natively built feature on mobile</p>
        <p>Modmail serves as <span class="bold reddit-txt"> a native messaging system for mods to communicate with members of their communities, their team, and mod teams of other communities.</span>
           This provides a collaborative, consistent space for communication across mod teams within the Reddit system. </p>
        <p>At this point, the modmail experience in the app was the same as the mobile website, offering, resulting in issues with intuitiveness and usability. More specifically, the experiece lacked content prioritization, platform specific design practices, and screen size optimization for a mobile app.</p>
        <p>As part of a larger effort to redesign and build modmail into a native app expereince, my work <span class="bold reddit-txt">focuses on the flow of composing a new message.</span></p>

        <p class="heading bold">upon first look, writing a new modmail message made no sense to me, this was a specific problem I aimed to solve.</p>
        <p>With the existing design, a mod was to "Post from" a specific community and the three choice types were "Moderator Discussion", "To User", and "To Subreddit".</p>
        <p>But what did a "Moderator Discussion" mean? Where would this go? Asking my mentor, this was a discussion post amongst the mods in the community selected in "Post from". While this is offered, many mods use Slack or Discord to have team discussions, likely because of the difficult experience Modmail offers.</p>
        <p>As for "To User" and "To Subreddit", selecting either of these options led to a input field to appear to type a specific community or username in. This was rather jarring in the change of the interface and required the user to be utmost precise with their inputted names.</p>
        <p>At the bottom, mods often forget to toggle "Hide my username" to on, as they wanted to avoid disclosing their indiviudal username and send messages as "the mod team", preventing individual harassment from upset community members mods often deal with.</p>
